<p style="color: azure;font-size: 20px;"> Once Zara Chabby escaped the company of his disciples and went out wandering in the forest, 
    he found himself among the grass and the swaying trees.
     The rustling of leaves and the chirping of birds provided him with a
      sense of calmness and tranquility that he had not experienced before. 
</p>   





<p style="color: azure;font-size: 20px;"> 
As he walked, he noticed that the forest was alive with various forms of life.
 Birds fluttered, insects crawled,
 and animals roamed freely. It was a perfect example of how everything in nature is imbalanced,
  yet everything grows.
 <p style="color: azure;font-size: 20px;"> 

 Zara Chabby knew that he needed to find his path, and he was prepared to face any pain and resistance that might come his way. 
 He understood that growth is essential,
  even if it is challenging. Much like the forest, where the trees grow tall and the bushes spread out, he realized that he needed to find his place in the world.

<p style="color: azure;font-size: 20px;"> 
As he sat on the rock, gazing out at the landscape before him, he thought about the nature of life. 
He longed for life, but he also knew that living forever would not be a cure. Everything has a beginning and an end,
and it is this impermanence that makes life worth living. It is the fleeting nature of life that makes each moment precious,
 and it is our responsibility to make the most of it.

</p>




     
<p style="color: azure;font-size: 20px;">
Just then, an eagle with a snake flew above him. The snake was not prey, but a friend to the eagle. 
Zara Chabby saw them as the wisest and proudest animals. The eagle represented freedom, while the snake symbolized transformation. The two together were a perfect embodiment of the cyclical nature of life.
“How beautiful” Zara Chabby said to his heart “The wisest animal and the prodest animal,truely my animals” he went on.
“If my pride grows too much for me,let my wisdow carry me to greater hieghts” he finally said,
but just as he uttered there words the eagle and the serpant disended upon him.
 
</p>



<p style="color: azure;font-size: 20px;"> 
Zara Chabby gazed at the animals and they gazed at him back deeply too.
“Who are you” said the animals in unilision
“I am nobody of too much importance” replaid Zara Chabby “But pay me what is it that you are?” Zara chabby asked.
“We are union,the representation of the perfect animal,i soar high enogh so that 
 we appear small in the eyes of those who cannot fly” replaid the animals.
“Also if i must sting ,my bite” said the serpant “You would die in argonising pain”
Zara Chabby laughed whole heartedly “How can a snake’s poison kill a dragon like me?” he said with laughter in his voice.
The animals stood in awe,
“But  now you see this cave behind me,she is my home and please do pay me a visit when ever you can,your compay does stimulate me”
