    As Zara-Chabby wandered about, his mind was consumed by the cry of distress that had grown silent.
     Was it the Super monk calling out to him? He searched for the source, 
     but grew weary and decided to rest beneath the shade of an oak tree. <br>
 </p>   
 
 

        <section class="chap"> 
        <div class="chap1">
 <p style="color: azure;font-size: 20px;">It was then that he fell asleep and entered a vivid dream. </p> 

 
</div>
</section>
  






 <p style="color: azure;font-size: 20px;"> 
In this dream, Zara-Chabby found himself in a garden filled with a plethora of fruits. 
He marveled at the variety before him, from pumpkins to pawpaws, and apples to bananas.
 Yet, despite the abundance of sweet and bitter fruits, he longed for something more fulfilling.<br>
‘I am a warrior and i do not like sweet foods,even the sweetest woman is still bitter” he said to himself.

</p>

<p style="color: azure;font-size: 20px;"> 
His prence in the garden was serene like a spirit.This garden seemeed to be a labrynth a mace,one that tangled itself up.
He walked for at what seemed to be hours,days even however he did  not tire however he did not succed.
He then came to a hault a rumbling stop,he soul shock,“Ah there it goes again,that feeling” he chattered with himself ,that which is within me shakes,
    i wonder want causes that".

						</div>
						</section>




    
<p style="color: azure;font-size: 20px;">
He gazed around himself and saw that he was where he had all started from.Then a louder cry thrice harder than before.
He had raisen from his sleep abupruptly.
Was it the Super monk that called yet again. He looked directly above him and saw that the sun was directly above him
 at ‘noon’ it was as though he had never 
slept in the first place
