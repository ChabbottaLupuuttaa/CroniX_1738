							<h2><b><i> "Expect Nothing, Gain Everything: Embracing the Reality of Ingratitude"</i></b></h2>
                            <h3> Derived from Dale Carnigie's ground breaking book</h3>
							
							   <p>
                                Our innate human nature leans towards expecting gratitude, yet the reality is we often 
                                receive it rarely, if at all. This can lead to disappointment and resentment, but what if we
                                 shifted our perspective?


                               </p>
                              

 
                                 <p>  
                                    "If you saved a man's life,would tou expect him to be grateful?, You might-Samuel Liebowitz,
                                    who was a famous criminal lawyer before he became a judge,saved "seventy two men" from going to the electric chair!<br> 
                                    how many of these men  do think stooped to thank Liebowitz?or even thought of sending him a gift card?How many?Guess?....Thats right -none.
                                   </p>


                                       <p> And when it comes to money matters it is even worse</p>
                               <p> 
                                  Just like any muscle, gratitude requires exercise to grow. The bodybuilders understand this principle well. 
                                  When encountering ingratitude, remember this analogy. It's not a reflection of your actions,
                                  but rather a reflection of the individual's lack of cultivated appreciation.
                                </p>

                                 <p> 
                                    "Old Marcus Aurelius,one of the wisest men to ever rule the Great Roman Empire.He wrote in his
                                    diary one day:'Today i am going to met people who talk too much-people who are selfish,egotistic,ungrateful,
                                    But iwont be suprised or distresed for i cannot  imagine  a world without such people'"

                                 <p> 
                                    Grumbling about ingratitude only fuels our own negativity. Instead, let's ponder on alternative perspectives. 
                                    Perhaps the act was expected and not considered a favor, or perhaps our relationship with the individual lacks genuine connection. Ultimately, 
                                    the focus should be on the act itself, not the anticipated reaction. 
                                 </p>

                                 .Look it up in Saint Luke When Christ turned to his disciples and asked'Where are the other nine?' they had al
                                 l disappeared ,run away without any thanks!" Now let me ask you a question ,Do you expect more gratidude that was given 
                                 Jesus Christ?"
                                </p>

                                Human nature will remain constant throughout our lifetime. Complaints, tears,
                                 and fights will not change its fundamental essence. Instead of seeking a gratitude that may not come, 
                                let's embrace reality and find peace in the act itself.

       <h2>In 1704, Isaac Newton Predicts the World Will End in 2060</h2>

            <p>
                We have become quite used to pronouncements of doom, from scientists predicting the sixth mass extinction due to 
                the measurable effects of climate change, and from religionists declaring the apocalypse due to a surfeit of sin. 
                It’s almost impossible to imagine these two groups of people agreeing on anything other than the ominous portent of 
                their respective messages. But in the early days of the scientific revolution—the days of Shakespeare contemporary 
                Francis Bacon, and later 17th century Descartes—it was not at all unusual to find both kinds of reasoning, or 
                unreasoning,
                 in the same person, along with beliefs in magic, divination, astrology, etc.
            </p>
                          <p> 
                           Yet even in this maelstrom of heterodox thought and practices,
                            Sir Isaac Newton stood out as a particularly odd co-existence of esoteric biblical prophecy, occult beliefs, and 
                            a rigid, formal mathematics that not only adhered to the inductive scientific method, but also expanded its 
                            potential by applying general axioms to specific cases. Yet many of Newton’s general principles would seem 
                            totally inimical to the naturalism of most physicists today. As he was formulating the principles of gravity and three
                             laws of motion, for example, Newton also sought the legendary Philosopher’s Stone and attempted to turn metal to gold.
                              Moreover, the devoutly religious Newton wrote theological treatises interpreting Biblical prophecies and predicting
                               the end of the world. 
                           The date he arrived at? 2060.

                    </section> 
                




                           <p> 

                                   Newton seems, writes science blog Another Pale Blue Dot,<br> <i> “as confident of his predictions
                                    in this realm as he was in the rational world of science."</i>
                            </p>


                            <p> 
                                    In a 1704 letter exhibited at Jerusalem’s Hebrew University, above, Newton describes his “recconing”:

<p>  
<i>  " So then the time times & half a time are 42 months or 1260 days or three years & an half, recconing twelve months to a yeare & 30 days to a month as was done in the Calendar of the primitive year. And the days of short lived Beasts being put for the years of lived [sic] kingdoms, the period of 1260 days, if dated from the complete conquest of the three kings A.C. 800, will end A.C. 2060. It may end later, but I see no reason for its ending sooner."

</i>
</p>


<p> 
Newton further demonstrates his confidence in the next sentence, writing that his intent, “though not to assert” an answer, should in any event “put a stop the rash conjectures of fancifull men who are frequently predicting the time of the end.” Indeed. So how did he arrive at this number? Newton applied a rigorous method, that is to be sure.

If you have the patience for exhaustive description of how he worked out his prediction using the Book of Daniel, you may read one here by historian of science Stephen Snobelen, who also points out how widespread the interest in Newton’s odd beliefs has become, reaching across every continent, though scholars have known about this side of the Enlightenment giant for a long time.

							     <h2>Are zebras black with white stripes or white with black stripes?</h2>
                

              <p> 
              <i>In this Tiny Expedition, we start with an age-old question. 
               Are zebras white with black stripes or black with white stripes?
              </i> 
           </p>
            
           <p> 
              Greg Barsh, MD, PhD, is the resident expert on animal morphology at the HudsonAlpha
               Institute for Biotechnology, and he has a definitive answer.
           </p>


<p> <b> “Zebras are black with white stripes.” </b></p>

<p>  <i> How is he so sure?</i><br>

Barsh explains, <i> “The reason we know that is…some of the early work we did on zebras was a collaboration with an owner of a zebra. We visited her once, and we asked her that exact same question.”</i> 
</p>

 <p> <i>The collaborator shaved a little hair away and revealed that zebras have completely black skin. </i>   </p>

   
          
            
            
<p> 
    Zebras aren’t alone in their stripiness though. Most equids—relatives of the horse—have some kind of striping.
     The primary exception is the modern domesticated horse. Only dun horses, a small minority of domesticated horses,
      still feature some striping.   <br>

However, equids all come from a common ancestor, 
meaning at some point domesticated horses had stripes…and lost them.

							    <h2>Lamborghini's Origin story</h2>
    <p>
    Lamborghini is an Italian luxury sports car manufacturer known for producing high-performance vehicles. The company was founded by Ferruccio Lamborghini, an Italian industrialist and entrepreneur, in 1963.

Ferruccio Lamborghini initially started his career as a tractor manufacturer. He established a successful business called Lamborghini Trattori, which produced agricultural machinery. As a wealthy and successful businessman, Lamborghini had a passion for luxury cars and owned several prestigious models,
 including Ferrari cars.
    </p>



    <p>
     However, Lamborghini became dissatisfied with his Ferrari cars and experienced multiple issues with them. He believed that the vehicles lacked certain features and had mechanical problems. Frustrated with Ferrari's response to his concerns, Lamborghini decided to build his own cars to compete with Ferrari.

In 1963, Ferruccio Lamborghini founded the company Automobili Lamborghini in Sant'Agata Bolognese, Italy. He assembled a team of talented engineers, including Giotto Bizzarrini and Gianpaolo Dallara, to develop his vision of a perfect sports car.
